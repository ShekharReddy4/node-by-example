title: Node by Example - Intro
---

#### Hello and welcome to Node by Example!

Our end goal here is to provide an always up-to-date (in line with the current LTS release) list of examples sorted by skill level to help all walks of life get started in Node.js!

We do have a few caveats we'd like to warn you about first:

- We assume you have the basic understanding of the fundamentals of JavaScript.
- Are using current LTS release of Node.js

This project is relatively new, so content is scarce. But don't let that discourage you! If you're new to Node.js and would like to see certain things covered, or would like to contribute an example then please be sure to check out the [GitHub issues](https://github.com/joshmanders/node-by-example/issues)&nbsp;and follow us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/nodebyexample)!

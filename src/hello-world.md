# Hello World

Our first program is a very simple example, but it's the bare minimum to getting you started
in Node.js. It will print the classic "Hello World" message.

```js
'use strict';

console.log('Hello World');
```

`console` is a global variable available in all modules. Read more about it in the [Node.js Docs](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v4.x/docs/api/console.html).

To run the program, put the code in `hello-world.js` and run

```sh
node hello-world.js
Hello World
```

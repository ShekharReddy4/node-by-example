# Hello World

Our first program is a very simple example, but it's the bare minimum to getting you started
in Node.js. It will print the classic "Hello World" message.

```js
console.log(`Hello World`)
```

To run the program, put the code in `hello-world.js` and run

```sh
node hello-world.js
Hello World
```
